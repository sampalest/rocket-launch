# WITH MADRID

I have deployed this project in my own server, so you can use the bot using `@SamRocketBot`.
The server is humble so treat it with care ðŸ™‚.

## Why haven't I used Bernard?

I've had a lot of trouble getting it to work on macOS.
I've tried it on macOS Ventura 13.6.3 (Intel) and macOS Sonoma 14.2.1. (Apple Silicon)
Apparently, there was the same issue. The service would start, but it never actually worked.

After thorough investigation, I came up with the idea of switching the operating system and trying it on Linux, with Ubuntu 23.10.
To my surprise, the software started working, but with an error interrupting the execution when a message is processed.

I found someone who had fixed it by forking the library, but I didn't feel very confident due to the lack of documentation and potential issues that could arise later, so I decided do it with another tools.
